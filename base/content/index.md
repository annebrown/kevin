## Description

Headless, framework-agnostic data source

## Purpose

Content logic separation

Special-focus, independent views and IFs

Single source of truth for prototyping and testing multiple client apps

Used for capture, storage and access to non-sensitive technology development docs and data.

## Documentation

Project templates `@/templates` hold the docs (single source of truth) for client app design considerations.

## Content Maintenance

### Templates

Templates `@/templates` facilitate consistent content.

### Dynamic Frontmatter

VS Code scripts and tasks are employed to provide dynamic frontmatter fields.

Ex: `lastModified: 'YYYY-MM-DD'` - dynamimcally updated on save

Promotes consistency, streamlines content maint and reduces human error
