WebSocket is a communication protocol that uses real-time, bi-directional communications over a single TCP connection between server and client software.

It can be configured to watch for changes in local and remote app sources, for example, in order to trigger HMR, or, to  clear cache, and rebuild and redeploy using new configs and content.
