## Description

Vite, Nuxt's default build tool, provides HMR and only compiles the code rqd for the current page or component, resulting in smaller bundle sizes, more efficient development and faster build times.

## Webpack

Nuxt can be to configured to use Webpack, a more mature, slower bundler (useful for comparing core framework performances).
