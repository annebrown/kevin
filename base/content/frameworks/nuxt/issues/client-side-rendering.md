## Rendered Element Disappears

Navi tree renders for a second, then disappears completely.

## Possible Causes

### Hydration Mis-Match

Hydration mismatch between server-side and client-side rendering.

## Try `<client-only>`

Render element only on client side:

```vue
<template>
  <client-only>
    <SomeNavigationComponent v-if="navigation" :items="navigation" />
    <p v-else>Loading navigation...</p>
  </client-only>
</template>
```

## Try Async Data Loading

Asynchronously loaded data could be temporarily available, but then reset.  Replace `useAsyncData`

with `useLazyAsyncData` to alieviate SSR and hydration issues.

```vue
<script setup>
const { data: navigation } = useLazyAsyncData('navigation', () =>
  fetchContentNavigation()
)
</script>
```

## Reactivity

Use `toRef` to ensure data is properly reactive:

```vue
<script setup>
import { toRef } from 'vue'

const { data } = useLazyAsyncData('navigation', () =>
  fetchContentNavigation()
)
const navigation = toRef(data)
</script>
```

## Add Error Handling

Add error handling to data fetching :

```vue
<script setup>
const { data: navigation, error } = useLazyAsyncData('navigation', () =>
  fetchContentNavigation()
)

watch(error, (newError) => {
  if (newError) {
    console.error('Error fetching navigation:', newError)
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <client-only>
    <div v-if="error">Error loading navigation: {{ error }}</div>
    <NSomeNavigationComponent  v-else-if="navigation" :items="navigation" />
    <p v-else>Loading navigation...</p>
  </client-only>
</template>
```

## Try Conflicting Styles Check

Ensure no global styles or other components are hiding the data after it's rendered.


## Try Console Logging


```vue
<script setup>
// ... other code ...

watch(() => props.items, (newItems) => {
  console.log('Navigation items changed:', newItems)
}, { deep: true })

onMounted(() => {
  console.log('SomeNavigationComponent mounted')
})

onUnmounted(() => {
  console.log('SomeNavigationComponent unmounted')
})
</script>
```
- Would identify if the component is being unmounted or if the data is changing unexpectedly.
If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions, please provide more details about your Nuxt configuration, any error messages you're seeing in the console, and the structure of your navigation data. This will help in further diagnosing and resolving the problem.


## Suggesting Another Approach

There may be a more efficient approach to determining the cause of this problem of the tree disappearing.  Can you determine what change was made to the previous /components/navi/NavigationTree.vue component, that may have caused the tree to be rerendered, thus disappearing the one loaded at the time that the app was initially loaded?  Could it be an error in the styling coding that is stopping the navigation tree element from completely rendering?


Based on the conversation history and the changes we've made to the NavigationTree.vue component, there are a few potential causes for the navigation tree disappearing after initial render. Let's examine the most recent changes and identify possible issues:
Reactive data handling: In our latest changes, we introduced a new handleClick function and modified how we handle the click event. This change in reactivity could potentially cause a re-render of the entire tree. To isolate this, we can try moving the handleClick function outside of the component setup:

<script setup lang="ts">
// ... other imports and code

const handleClick = (event: Event, item: any, toggleExpand: Function) => {
  if (hasChildren(item)) {
    event.preventDefault()
    toggleExpand(item._path)
  }
}
</script>
Style changes: We made significant changes to the component's styling. It's possible that a CSS rule is causing the tree to be hidden after initial render. Let's review the style changes:

<style scoped>
.nav-tree {
  padding-left: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
}

.nav-subtree {
  padding-left: 1rem;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.nav-item {
  display: flex;
}

.nav-link {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit;
  width: 100%;
}

.link-text {
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.expand-icon {
  margin-left: 0.5em;
}
</style>
To isolate if it's a styling issue, we can temporarily remove all styles except for basic visibility:

<style scoped>
.nav-tree, .nav-subtree {
  display: block !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
}
</style>
Computed properties and watchers: The filteredItems computed property and the route watcher could be causing unexpected re-renders. We can try simplifying these:

<script setup lang="ts">
// ... other code

const filteredItems = computed(() => props.items)

// Remove the route watcher for now
// watch(() => route.path, ...)
</script>
Recursive component issue: The recursive nature of the component could be causing issues. We can try adding a key to the recursive component to ensure proper rendering:

<template>
  <!-- ... other template code ... -->
  <NaviNavigationTree
    v-if="expandedItems.has(item._path) && hasChildren(item)"
    :items="getFilteredChildren(item)"
    :depth="depth + 1"
    :key="item._path"
  />
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
To determine the exact cause, I recommend applying these changes one at a time and testing after each change. This process of elimination will help identify which specific change is causing the tree to disappear.
If none of these changes resolve the issue, it's possible that the problem lies in how the navigation data is being fetched or passed to the component. In that case, we should review the parent component that's using NaviNavigationTree and ensure that the navigation data is being properly fetched and maintained.
Nuxt Content navigation usage provides guidelines on how to properly fetch and use navigation data, which might be helpful in troubleshooting this issue.
Let me know which of these changes, if any, help resolve the issue, and we can further refine the solution based on your findings.
