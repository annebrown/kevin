MkDocs has themes, plugins, and Python markdown extensions. Some of these are already built-in to MkDocs or mkdocs-material, and don't need to be installed.  Add-ons and features are all added and configured in the `meta.yml` file.

## Installing Add-Ons

To install non-built-in plugins, themes and python extensions, activate the project [venv](../install.md#activate-venv) and:

```bash
pip install [full-name-of-add-on]
```
