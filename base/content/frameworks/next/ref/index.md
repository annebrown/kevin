## Page

- route UI

## Layout

- Shared UI for folder and children
- Preserves state, remains interactive, does not rerender
- By default, layouts are nested. Eg, docs with custom sidebar and nav
- Only root layout can have `<html>` and `<body>` elements.
- Layouts are Svr Components by default
- Can fetch data
- No passing data btw parent and child layout
- Don't have access to pathname.
- Don't have access to route segments below itself
