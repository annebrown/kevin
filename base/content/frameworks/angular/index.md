## Description

Developed by Google.

> Well documented, scalable, efficient, web dev framework with a rich set of tools, APIs and libs, and a large and active community.


Angular's SPA design, loads all necessary code into a single page.  

Its heavy reliance on components as it fundamental building block, allows for independent development, maintenance, and testing, of components.  This makes it easier to break complex tasks into smaller ones, enabling more intuitive patterns, consistent IF, and simplifying code organization and collab.

Content changes are rendered dynamically, loading only that part of the page that needs updating, thus reducing traffic and increasing responsiveness.

Angular's data binding facilitates dynamic interface design.  

Angular is  particularly well-suited for large-scale, enterprise-level apps, due to its ability to handle large, robust, long term, complex projects with high performance and maintainability requirements.
