## Description

Open-source framework for developing cross-platform desktop apps using mature, stable and widely adopted web technologies.

## Framework

Electron uses the Chromium engine (the open-source project for Google's Chrome browser) as the fundamental building block for most of its core functionality, including `Blink` (Rendering Engine) and V8 (JavaScript Engine) and many other components.

## Rendering

Blink handles visual presentation, including DOM mgmt and parsing and displaying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 Electron uses the chrome-sandbox binary for its render process. See [sandboxing](/public/frameworks/electron/sandboxing)
