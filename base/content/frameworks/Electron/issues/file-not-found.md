## Error

```log
(node:63299) electron: Failed to load URL: file:///home/anne/electron/shortcut-panel/dist/index.html with error: ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
(Use `electron --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

## Problem

`index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`, are not in same location as the javascript files generated by the typescript compiler.

index.html and related files should be in project root.  By default, Electron looks for `index.html` in same directory as  javascript files. However, that file is not being generated using typescript.

Change: `win.loadFile('index.html');` to `win.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, '../index.html'));` in `@/main.ts`.
