[9913:0721/075156.428196:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/Hyper/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

Fix perms prob:

```bash
sudo chown root /opt/Hyper/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 /opt/Hyper/chrome-sandbox
```
