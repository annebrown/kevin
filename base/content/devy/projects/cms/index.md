## Description

The [Headless CMS project](https://github.com/annebrown/dotfiles) is a framework-agnostic data source, for use in prototyping and testing.

Also used for capture, storage and access to non-sensitive technology development docs and data.

Dynamic frontmatter fields are employed using VS Code scripts (See [VS Code Dynamic Markdown](../../tooling/1.vscode/dynamic-markdown.md/)), to promote consistency, improve CMS maint, and reduce human error.

Ex: `lastModified: 'YYYY-MM-DD'` frontmatter field - dynamimcally updated on save
